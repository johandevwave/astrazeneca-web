# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## TV Series Search Frontend

This is a web application that allows users to search for information about TV series using the TV Maze API. The site has two views, one for detailed information about a series and another for search results. It is written using ReactJS and uses Axios for API requests.

## features
* Search for TV series by name
* View detailed information about a specific series

## Technologies Used

### React
React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web applications. It is used here in version 18.2.0.
React-dom is also a part of React used to render components to the DOM.
### Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is an officially recommended library for creating and managing Redux stores in React apps. It is used here in version 1.9.3.
React-redux is also used to connect Redux stores with React components in version 8.0.5.

### React Router
React-router is a library used to handle routing in a React app. It is used here in version 6.10.0.
React-router-dom is used to use React Router with the DOM in version 6.10.0.
History is also used to handle history and routing in version 5.3.0.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is an open-source language that is a strongly-typed variant of JavaScript. It is used here in version 4.9.5.

### Testing Library
Testing Library is a library used to write unit tests in React. It is used here in version 14.0.0.
Testing Library/jest-dom and Testing Library/user-event are used to write unit tests with Jest in version 5.16.5 and 13.5.0 respectively.
@types/jest is also used to provide TypeScript support to Jest in version 27.5.2.

### Ramda
Ramda is a library for functional programming in JavaScript. It is used here in version 0.28.0.
@types/ramda is also used to provide TypeScript support to Ramda in version 0.28.23.

### Sass
Sass is a CSS preprocessor used to increase efficiency when writing CSS code. It is used here in version 1.60.0.
Tailwindcss is also used to write CSS code and add pre-defined classes in version 3.3.1.

### Other Dependencies

MSW is used to mock API calls in unit tests in version 1.2.1. 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
